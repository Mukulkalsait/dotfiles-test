========================================
It looks like you're using a development version of Neovim (v0.11.0-dev), which may not be stable for everyday use. But if you're comfortable with that, I can help you with the installation process!

Here's a general guide to install Neovim on your system, depending on what you're using (Linux, macOS, or Windows):
For Linux (using apt as an example):

    Update package list:

# sudo apt update

Install dependencies:

# sudo apt install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl

Clone the Neovim repository:

# git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git

# cd neovim

Checkout the development branch (if needed): If you want the latest development version, you can fetch the branch with:

# git checkout nightly

Build Neovim:

# make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# sudo make install

For macOS:

If you're installing the development version (v0.11.0-dev), it’s important to know that you may be dealing with some bugs, as this is the latest development branch.
Let me know which platform you're on, and I can give more detailed instructions if needed!
